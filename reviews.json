Even though it wasn't on the menu, they made me the most unique, spectacularly dazzling, taste bud popping Bloody Mary. Instead of a tomato juice based mixer, I believe they used a freshly pureed tomato. The drink was light pink & exceptionally spiced!  We'll be going back again & again. Thanks for the experience.",

Sit at small  intimate tables tucked in the wine storage racks. Affordable tasting flights are available at the bar pair well with a mountain sunset view. The restaurant is deceptively big and quite popular. Great foodie options to try, including duck confit tacos, Thai mussels, meatballs, citrus goat cheese salad, charcuterie, small bites, entrees and desserts. Servers are very knowledgeable about wine for pairing, and bottles are for sale. Easy place to drop several hundred dollars on wine and food at dinner an evening out with friends, but also possible to order affordable items on a date and have a great time.",

Nice private areas in the cellar . The flights do not change often and contain wines that they want to sell some are not always what I would choose . Wines by the glass as well as by the bottle prices are reasonable. Food menu looked good but we did not try. Close to my location and making it a regular hang out .",
