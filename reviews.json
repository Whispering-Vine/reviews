The food, the drinks (obviously), and the staff are consistently excellent.\n\nThey have a great selection of unique, flavorful dishes, and the salt and vinegar tater tots are an absolute staple for us every visit. The charcuterie board is our go-to appetizer—it’s loaded with delicious options and always hits the mark.\n\nThe staff is incredibly friendly and welcoming, and we really enjoy being able to wander around and choose a bottle (or bottles) of wine to enjoy with dinner. It adds to the overall experience and makes it feel relaxed and personal.\n\nPricing is very fair for the quality of food, the portion sizes, and the level of service. The wine and alcohol pricing is also very competitive with local shops, and unlike many restaurants, you don’t pay an inflated premium on wine here.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend Whispering Vine. It’s a consistently great experience and one of our favorite spots in town.",

Nice private areas in the cellar . The flights do not change often and contain wines that they want to sell some are not always what I would choose . Wines by the glass as well as by the bottle prices are reasonable. Food menu looked good but we did not try. Close to my location and making it a regular hang out .\n\nSince my last review I have frequently dropped in. Hot food is not served till 4pm, however nice dishes are being served. Wine prices are very reasonable considering Reno prices have sored sky high in the past few years.  The atmosphere is charming an older building formerly known as the glory hole a steak house, with a hint of contemporary flare. Patio is nice in spring through autumn and gets pretty noisy in the evenings as many come from all over. Sunday they are closed sad but true. Try them any other day you will be happy you did if you are looking for a cool wine shop with very friendly and knowledgeable staff.",

If you’re more of a spirit person, they have some interesting bottles to consider. With a full bar, they can accommodate anyone with wine, beer, or cocktails. The portions are on the small side, but the food is oh so delicious. Reservations are highly recommended. It tends to be very loud so request the tall tables by the window for a slightly quieter experience.  During the summer the patio is nice.",

        "comment": "First time at this Whispering Vine. The one on 4th street is better, in my opinion.  The layout at this one is harder to maneuver. Service was extremely slow. At one point I walked up to the bar to get our own drinks and the bartender assured me she would take the drinks to our table outdoors.  Not to my liking.",

(They have a couple other \"Appetizers\" I'm gluten free I haven't had them. I digress)\nDry cheese, dry meat, sloppily thrown in a plate. It's quite expensive for what I is.
