    "comment": "A nice wine bar , they have some nice bottles for sale as well, glass size is generous glasses are not very big however. Some staff are new others more seasoned . Nice private areas in the cellar . The flights do not change often and contain wines that they want to sell some are not always what I would choose . Wines by the glass as well as by the bottle prices are reasonable. Food menu looked good but we did not try. Close to my location and making it a regular hang out .\n\nSince my last review I have frequently dropped in. Hot food is not served till 4pm, however nice dishes are being served. Wine prices are very reasonable considering Reno prices have sored sky high in the past few years.  The atmosphere is charming an older building formerly known as the glory hole a steak house, with a hint of contemporary flare. Patio is nice in spring through autumn and gets pretty noisy in the evenings as many come from all over. Sunday they are closed sad but true. Try them any other day you will be happy you did if you are looking for a cool wine shop with very friendly and knowledgeable staff.",

Our 9oz flights are rotated weekly at our 4th Street location. We hope you return to try our food menu, the burger and truffle tots are a favorite. Cheers!",

    "comment": "Lovely place to go peruse wines and spirits, and enjoy some fantastic food.  Excellent selection of wines that are reasonably priced. If you’re more of a spirit person, they have some interesting bottles to consider. With a full bar, they can accommodate anyone with wine, beer, or cocktails. The portions are on the small side, but the food is oh so delicious. Reservations are highly recommended. It tends to be very loud so request the tall tables by the window for a slightly quieter experience.  During the summer the patio is nice.",
